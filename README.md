Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.

In our code pattern, we will provide another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, we will use the webhook feature of Watson Assistant to pass the question onto our Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we can return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our customers’ problems.
